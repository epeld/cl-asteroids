# Asteroids!
  
  This is a test to see how common lisp can be used to aid development by allowing for interactively changing a running program's implementation.

  If an error is encountered, the debugger should allow you to fix the error and continue without having to restart the app.

  This interactivity also allows for fast experimentation e.g with colors and different graphics primitives.
