# Hello #
  
This is an asteroids clone developmed using `cl-opengl`.

For now, just running `(ql:quickload :cl-game)` should be enough to get going.

# Current TODOs #

1) Add some rocks
2) Apply 'warping' - forcing ship to stay within screen bounds
3) Use error handler to 'save' main thread from crashing
4) Add visual effect (= "exhaust") when thrusting
5) Figure out units of length
6) Change ship color depending on state
